<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: sans-serif;">To say Elon Musk is an interesting guy would be an understatement. He goes from brilliant to bozo and back again in a blink. It’s like watching a fast ping-pong match.<br><br>

Musk’s latest effort is an AI based on X (formerly known as Twitter) content called Grok that I believe will disrupt conversational AI.<br><br>

Shaking up a new market is a good thing in many cases because, too often, everyone starts copying each other, and you end up with a lot of similar and increasingly boring offerings. While Musk does a lot of things, he doesn’t do boring, except, of course, the company by that same name.<br><br>

Let’s chat about Grok this week. Then, we’ll close with my Product of the Week, the Surface Laptop Studio 2. Microsoft sent me one, so now I have experience using it.</p><br><br>

<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: sans-serif;"><b>The Good</b> <br><br>
We don’t seem to like to make fun of things, which I think is a shame. While I don’t like many things about Tesla, I do like that it has a touch of whimsy in its execution that must bring a smile to the faces of Tesla drivers. For instance:<br><br>

The Tesla can make Jetson car sounds.<br>
You can change the car on the navigation screen to a variety of crazy vehicles.<br>
It can make a fart sound when someone sits in one of the seats.<br>
You can do karaoke in the car — Tesla calls it Caraoke.<br>
Tesla has a “bioweapon defense mode,” which is really just a good in-car air filter, but I love the name — and a ton of Easter eggs, like James Bond’s submersible Lotus.<br>
Tesla was the first to allow you to use your phone or a card as the car key so the doors open when you approach.<br>
It has Dog Mode to keep your pets cool in the car on a hot day.<br>
You can block explicit song lyrics if kids are in the car — or leave them unblocked to teach your neighbor’s kids new words!
So, there is a really good chance Musk’s Grok AI will be fun to use. Assuming it eventually works as advertised, since most products like this have early teething problems and crashes, I expect this could be a great way to lighten your mood while traveling or killing time.
<br>
We need more whimsy in our lives since so much of the news is negative. Two major wars are going on, both of which could escalate and spread to nuclear weapons, and politics have gotten so ugly it is almost painful to read or watch the news now. So, most people should appreciate a little humor in this Debbie Downer world (SNL reference).<br><br>

However, Grok also has some problems.<br><br>

<b>The Bad (There Is No Ugly)</b><br><br>
First, you must be an X Premium member to use Grok. That’ll cost you $16 a month. ChatGPT costs $20 a month, but it appears to have far more substance behind it, and it’s flowing into Microsoft Office via another monthly extra charge.<br><br>

Grok’s announcement indicated the AI will include real-time knowledge from X/Twitter. However, that information rarely contains the answers to questions (with respect to the overall traffic). Since Musk largely cut out moderators on the platform, its accuracy and quality have degraded while the individual protections from being improperly attacked have evaporated. That means the X training data is likely horribly compromised.</p>
